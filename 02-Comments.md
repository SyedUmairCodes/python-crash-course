Comments are used to add notes and provide context about the code that you have wrote. It can be extremely useful if you are working with a team or are working on a big project.

In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol and are ignored by the interpreter when the code is run. The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work.
