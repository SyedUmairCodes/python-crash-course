Python contains many different built-in methods that are for the string data type and make working with strings easier. 

The `title()` methods will capitalize the first letter and make all other letters lowercase of any string that is passed into it and make the text look like a title.

The words *Hello*, *hello*, and *HELLO* will all be transformed into *Hello* when passed through the `title()` method in Python.

The `upper()` and `lower()` methods will make all the characters of the strings that are passed into them uppercase or lowercase respectively.
