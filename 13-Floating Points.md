Any numeric value that has a decimal point in it will be considered as a float in Python due to the fact that decimal points can appear anywhere in a number.

For the most part using floats is okay and your result will be the same as you expect it to be but some times it can be with an arbitrary numbers of decimal places in the result.

The arbitrary numbers can be ignored easily. Floats are also  the default type if they are used in any calculation in Python, even when it's without a float.
