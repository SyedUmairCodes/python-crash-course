In Python, there are a few rules that need to be followed when you're working with variables so that your code is easier to read and doesn't cause unnecessary errors.

The name of a variable can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores and must start with an underscore or a letter and not a number. 

If you're variable name contains two words then join them together with a underscore because spaces shouldn't be used in variable names since adding a space makes them two different words.

Python comes with some restricted keywords that are used in programming and those words can't be used as the name of a variable since Python has assigned a special function to them already.
