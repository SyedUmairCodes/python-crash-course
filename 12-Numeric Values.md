Almost all kind of programming requires working with numbers. Be it single or multi-digit integers or floating-points, calculations cannot be done without them.

The four basic arithmetic operations are done easily in Python using the + sign for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division.

Python supports the order of operations as well if you are calculating multiple values in a single statement. The order can be changed based on how you would like to calculate the result.

```Python
2+3*4 # Will return 14
(2+3)*4 # will return 20
```
