A variable is like a container. Every variable has a value that has been assigned to it and whenever you use the variable the value that was assigned to it will actually be used. A variable's value can be changed dynamically through code and it will hold the last value that was assigned to it.

Python allows you to assign more than one variable in a single line by separating their names and values with commas.

```Python
name, age, gender = "John", 12, "male"
```
