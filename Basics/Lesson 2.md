# Introduction to Variables

A variable is like a container. Every variable has a value that has been assigned to it and whenever you use the variable the value that was assigned to it will actually be used. A variable's value can be changed dynamically through code and it will hold the last value that was assigned to it. 

In Python, there are a few rules that need to be followed when you're working with variables so that your code is easier to read and doesn't cause unnecessary errors.

The name of a variable can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores and must start with an underscore or a letter and not a number. If you're variable name contains two words then join them together with a underscore because spaces shouldn't be used in variable names since adding a space makes them two different words.

Python comes with some restricted keywords that are used in programming and those words can't be used as the name of a variable since Python has assigned a special function to them already.

> The name of a variable should be simple enough so that it can be understood easily.

```python
my_message = "Hello Reader!"
```
