# Strings in Python

In Python if you want to type or store alphanumeric values in a variable or another object like a list or array you will use the *string* data type as it is the preferred data type for storing a series of characters. Anything that is written between two single or double quotes will be considered as a string in Python. 

```Python
message = "This text is a string"
```

## String Methods

Python contains many different built-in methods that are for the string data type and make working with strings easier. 

The `title()` methods will capitalize the first letter and make all other letters lowercase of any string that is passed into it and make the text look like a title.



> The words *Hello*, *hello*, and *HELLO* will all be transformed into *Hello* when passed through the `title()` method in Python.



The `upper()` and `lower()` methods will make all the characters of the strings that are passed into them uppercase or lowercase respectively.
