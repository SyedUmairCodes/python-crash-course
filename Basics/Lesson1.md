# Running Python Code

Python code is written in UTF-8 formatted plain text files that end with the `.py` extension so that the code editor and the Python interpreter can understand which files are to be treated as Python source code files.

The simplest program that you can write in any programming language including Python is to print the statement *Hello World!* on the screen or the console/command line of your computer.

In Python you use the built-in `print()` function that comes with almost all version of Python version 3 and will print whatever you have written between the parenthesis of the print function to your console. 

Code editors and IDEs like Visual Studio code and Jetbrains PyCharm are built with the functionality of syntax highlighting that means that each part of your code will be a different color if it's written correctly so that you can easily distinguish a variable from a function.
