# Python Crash Course

This repository contains my notes from the book `Python Crash Course - 3rd Edition` by Eric Matthes.

The notes are divided into sections like the book and each note is like a lesson and can also be used as a reference I- I guess... I didn't take notes from the first chapter and most of the code snippets so for that you'll need the book.

The book is available from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/python-crash-course-3rd-edition)
